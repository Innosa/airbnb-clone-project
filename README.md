To make design system ready to reduce duplication and accelerate new screens.
To improve accessibility and legibility to determine whether text is readable for all users.
To reduce visual bugs and iteration cycles for fewer layout regressions and fewer rounds of redesign needed.
To enable responsive and scalable design adapt quickly between mobile, tablet, desktop.
To help cross-disciplinary collaboration to the same properties for decisions and testing.
To support consistency in animations and states to behave more cohesively when states (hover, active, disabled) use predefined colors and timing.
To speed up onboarding and future maintenance so the new team members can pick up the visual language quickly; future updates are less error-prone.
